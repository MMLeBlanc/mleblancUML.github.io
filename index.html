<!--Displays some information on me as well as uses some css code to make things look a little better.
  I also included some code in the file normalize.css that I found while looking at tutorials on
  youtube. This file is used to make things a little easier for us to start. For example, the big
  thing that I needed it for was to make sure there was no margin on the body of the html code.I also
  used a google font so I had to include the link to that as well. Only the Home and Assignment3 links
  work -->

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, going into my 4th year.
          I am from Milford Massachusetts and I enjoy cooking and trying new types of whisky/ey. I watch a lot of youtube
          videos when I want to learn something new, especially in cooking. One of my favorite channels is
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpMy0Fg74eXXkvxJrtEn3w">Bon Appetit</a>. This is an image of
          my pet dog, Cooper. He is a Golden Retriever and is currently 13 years old!
