I ran into many problems with this assignment. The things I ran into the most problems with was getting the navbar to not move, while the
other content moved freely. Once I got this, I had problems with my content not being the correct width. Using the inspect source tool on
Google Chrome, I was able to find the right display property that gave me the proper result.
