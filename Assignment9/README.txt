Assignment 9:

Working Features:
    Most of the features requested by the assignment are working properly. The user
    is able to move tiles that are randomly generated and place them on the board. 
    When placed on the board, their score is updated so they have an idea of what
    kind of points they are going to get. There are three buttons that all have 
    different functions. Submit calculates the score and saves the player's score,
    while moving on to the next player. Reset is for when you make a mistake and want
    to take back what was on the board. It resets the score to 0, and allows for you
    to move the tiles again. 
Bugs:
    The bugs go hand-in-hand with the functioning features. You are able to drag and
    drop the tiles wherever you please, but the tiles don't have to be together in
    order for your score to be calculated. Also, if you make a mistake, and put a 
    tile in the wrong place, and you then move it again it is added to your score 
    again. Although the remedy to this is just resetting the board with the reset
    board button that just puts everything back to where it was intially. You are
    unable to check whether the word is valid or not, but I think I hit all the base
    requirements.
